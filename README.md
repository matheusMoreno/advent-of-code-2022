# Advent of Code 2022 üéÅ

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2022][advent] programming
puzzles.

My two main goals when tackling these puzzles are to exercise my programming/logical
abilities and to learn more about Rust. This means that these solutions are not
necessarily the optimal ones, nor are written in the most rustonic (is that a word?)
way possible, but they are somewhat organized and try to follow good practices.

You can run a program by going inside its directory and executing `cargo run`.
